# detect-and-segment-tumors-in-CT-image
Data Visualization: a toolkit to detect and segment tumors in CT image 
A medical image processing software â€“ Based on ITK-SNAPS

In this project ,we aim to create a tool ,like ITK-SNAP, that would be dedicated to two specific function, segmentation and 3D show, and would be easy to use and learn. Besides some basic functions in ITK-SNAPs, our tool is able to color the tumor and show the contour of tumor in both 2D and 3D ways. Our tool provides semi-automatic segmentation using active contour methods, as well as manual delineation and image navigation.It can support for different 3D image formats, including \*mha and \*nii.
Our design also emphasizes interaction and ease of use, with the development effort dedicated to the user interface. Our project is based on Python3 developing environment , and the GUI is implemented by PyQt5 .


Collaborated with my dearest roommates!
